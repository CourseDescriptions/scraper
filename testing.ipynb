There are 2 components to this class. First, speakers will give a 45-minute presentation, followed by 30 minutes of Q&amp;A with the students. The speaker component will also be open to the public. For the second component: students will participate in a facilitated discussion on reading materials related topically to the speaker of the week. Topic examples include: intersectional feminism, urban Indigenous women-led land rematriation, Indigenous resistance to the border, Black feminist abolition visions, music/poetry as resistance, local race and gender history, transnational feminisms, lived experiences of gender and race, reproductive justice, housing justice, Islam and feminism, Muslim and Arab organizing against militarism and racism, rape crisis and healing justice, Indigenous organizing against domestic violence, trans-Latina organizing, Filipino women’s transnational organizing against oppression, and immigrant and undocumented community and power building. Ultimately, this course seeks to familiarize SSU students with intersectional women of color-led feminisms and analytical language/vocabulary from the fields of Women’s and Gender Studies and Comparative Ethnic Studies so that students can deepen their understanding of the social and political landscape in which we all live.</td>\n",

       "87009  This 3-unit course pairs presentations by intersectional gender and race scholars, artists, and activists with related scholarship in the fields of Women’s and Gender Studies and Comparative Ethnic Studies. There are 2 components to this class. First, speakers will give a 45-minute presentation, followed by 30 minutes of Q&A with the students. The speaker component will also be open to the public. For the second component: students will participate in a facilitated discussion on reading materials related topically to the speaker of the week. Topic examples include: intersectional feminism, urban Indigenous women-led land rematriation, Indigenous resistance to the border, Black feminist abolition visions, music/poetry as resistance, local race and gender history, transnational feminisms, lived experiences of gender and race, reproductive justice, housing justice, Islam and feminism, Muslim and Arab organizing against militarism and racism, rape crisis and healing justice, Indigenous organizing against domestic violence, trans-Latina organizing, Filipino women’s transnational organizing against oppression, and immigrant and undocumented community and power building. Ultimately, this course seeks to familiarize SSU students with intersectional women of color-led feminisms and analytical language/vocabulary from the fields of Women’s and Gender Studies and Comparative Ethnic Studies so that students can deepen their understanding of the social and political landscape in which we all live.   \n",
